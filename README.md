# CalorieDesi 🍛

A professional Android health tracker that combines **Indian food calorie logging**
with **activity tracking** (phone step sensor + manual exercises), a **net-calorie
engine**, weight trends, and streaks/badges. Built with **Flutter**, local-first.

> Status: complete Flutter source. The Flutter/Android SDK is **not** bundled here —
> build locally with the steps below to produce an APK.

## Features
- **Step tracking** from the phone's built-in step counter (`pedometer`), with a
  per-day baseline that survives reboots.
- **Manual step override** per day when the sensor is unavailable (e.g. emulator).
- **Exercise logging** (cycling, running, push-ups, yoga, …) that **calculates
  calories burned** via MET / rep formulas using your weight.
- **Indian food library** of ~65 items (portion + calories + macros). Search,
  filter by category, add with quantity, edit/delete.
- **Net calorie balance**: `calories in − (BMR + step + exercise calories)`, with a
  BMR/TDEE engine (Mifflin-St Jeor) computed from your profile.
- **Weight log + trend chart** (`fl_chart`) toward a goal.
- **Goals, streaks & badges** for motivation.
- **Google (Gmail) sign-in** + profile (with a guest fallback so the app runs
  without Firebase configured).
- Polished **Material 3** UI (teal), light & dark.
- **Local-first**: all data stored on-device via Hive. No backend.

## Build & run (local)
Prerequisites: [Flutter SDK](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) (3.22+)
with the Android toolchain (`flutter doctor` all green).

```bash
# 1. Generate the Android platform shell (this repo ships lib/ + pubspec only).
flutter create --platforms=android --org com.caloriedesi --project-name caloriedesi .
#    If it overwrites any of our files, restore them:
git checkout -- pubspec.yaml lib/main.dart analysis_options.yaml README.md

# 2. Apply the Android config in docs/android_setup.md (permissions + minSdk).

# 3. Install deps, run tests, launch.
flutter pub get
flutter test
flutter run                 # on a connected device/emulator

# 4. Build a testable APK
flutter build apk --debug   # build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-debug.apk
```

For a **signed release APK / Play Store bundle** and **Google sign-in setup**
(Firebase project, `google-services.json`, SHA-1 registration, keystore), follow
[`docs/android_setup.md`](docs/android_setup.md).

## Calorie model
- **BMR (Mifflin-St Jeor):** `10·kg + 6.25·cm − 5·age + 5` (male) / `− 161` (female).
- **TDEE:** BMR × activity factor (1.2 – 1.9).
- **Steps:** `steps × 0.00057 × weightKg` kcal.
- **Exercise (duration):** `MET × 3.5 × weightKg / 200 × minutes`; reps use a
  weight-scaled kcal/rep; distance (running) converts km→minutes via pace.
- **Net:** `caloriesIn − (BMR + stepCalories + exerciseCalories)`. BMR (not TDEE)
  is the baseline so the activity factor isn't double-counted.

All values are typical estimates for general wellness tracking — not medical advice.

## Known limitations (this version)
- No cloud sync — data is per-device. Sign-in is required each launch (in-memory).
- Emulators have no step sensor; use the manual **Override** to test step features.
- Google sign-in needs Firebase config + SHA-1 to work in a real build (guest mode
  works without it).
